  The question that everyone asks, what is Object Oriented programming?
  Before answering the question we need to understand what is an Object.
  If you google the keyword "object" the answer would be something like this:

<code>
  obÂ·ject
  noun  
  1.
  a material thing that can be seen and touched:
  "he was dragging a large object"

  So the Question is what is Object in the Programming world? How to create an Object in Java?
  Per the definition above, Object is a material thing that can be seen or touched.
  Per the definition, Object is something that we can see or feel.
  But the question is,How can we see an object or touch in the programming world?
  An object is how we define things in the programming world.
  For example:
  let's say someone ask you for the "Login" object.
  Now, being a novice to programming you would think, what is "login" object.
  There is no physical understanding of the "login" object unless you name someone "login", not "logan".
  In the programming world, we define an object with its characteristics.
  For any login, we need minimum two things
  <li>1. username</li>
  <li>2. password</li>
  With the username and password under login, we created an object called login.
  Let's see how this thing looks in Java code.
  <code>
    public class Account 
     private int accountId;      
     private String username;     
     private String password;
    
  </code>
